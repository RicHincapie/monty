# Interpreter for Monty ByteCodes
 This is a fun non-interactive interpreter for Monty ByteCodes

## Motivation
This project is made for learning purposes and because ***#CisFun***.

It is part of the **Unit 01 â€” Higher-level Languages** at [Holberton School](https://www.holbertonschool.com/pathway_foundations).

## Prerequisites
This interpreter was built in Ubuntu trusty 14.04 LTS, please use a compatible operating system.

### Installation

Clone the repository at: [Monty ByteCodes Interpreter](https://github.com/ricarhincapie/monty)

Compile this way:

```
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic *.c -o monty
```

And then, inside the directory of compiling of using the absoulute path of it, do:
```
./monty <file>
```

### Use example
```
./monty


### Coding style
[Holberton School coding style](https://github.com/holbertonschool/Betty/wiki), which is inspired and slightly modifies the [Linux kernel coding style](https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/plain/Documentation/process/coding-style.rst)

#### Indentation example

Tabs equals to 4 spaces:
```
sample_func(char suffix)
{
    int var;
    var = 0;
    switch (suffix)
    {
    case 'G':
    case 'g':
        var = 30;
        break;
     }
}

#### Lenght of lines
The limit on the length of lines is **80 columns** and this is a strongly preferred limit.

#### Lenght of functions
Functions should be short and sweet, and do just one thing.
They must fit on **40 lines**, and do one thing and do that well.

## Built With
Visual Basic Code
Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
